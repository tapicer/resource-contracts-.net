Resource Contracts for .NET is an extension of Code Contracts enabling the specification and verification of resources usage constraints.

The first release focuses on dynamic memory consumption, including new annotaions aiming at specifying memory usage contracts in a per-method basis along with lifetime properties. These annotations can be both statically verified in a modular fashion or checked in run-time.
