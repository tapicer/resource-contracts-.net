\section{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusions}
In this work we presented an extension of  \textsc{Code Contracts} language to specify and verify the memory consumption of .NET programs. %where memory is a critical resource, obtaining with the verification a certificate that the program will never exceed a certain parametric memory usage. 
The tool integrates with Visual Studio enabling autocompletion, inline documentation, static verification and run-time checking as \textsc{Code Contracts} does. 

As a future work, we would like to enhance the usability of the tool by automatically inferring quantitative and lifetime annotations.
In this setting developers would only need to specify complex or hard-to-infer annotations, not worrying about annotations that can be easily inferred. In this matter we plan to port our previous work on inference of memory consumption for Java~\cite{garber08ismm} to .NET and extend other tools capable of inferring resource usage (e.g.,~\cite{gulwani2010reachability}) in order to make them capable of dealing with dynamic memory usage.
